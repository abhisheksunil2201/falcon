# Falcon

Falcon is a tree-walking interpreter I built using Go. I was driven by a fascination with the hidden structures and magic of languages. I yearned to understand how code transformed into action, building a bridge between the two.
Falcon tokenizes and parses source code in a REPL, building up an internal representation of the code called abstract syntax tree and then evaluate this tree

Major parts of falcon that have been built are

- Lexer
- Parser
- AST
- An Internal Object System
- Evaluator
